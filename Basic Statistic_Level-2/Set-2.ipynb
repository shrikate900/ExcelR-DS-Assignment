    "        The Normal Distribution has its link with the Central Limit Theorem, which states that ‘Any large sum of independent identically distribution random variables are approximately Normal then (X1 + X2) and (2X1) tends to have Normal distribution only If X1 and X2 are i.i.d and n is Large.\n",
    "      The Difference between 2X1 and (X1 + X2) is the magnitude they hold of two different sample subsets (X1 and X2) from the same source(population). X1 and X2 can be a different subset of a sample from a similar source (population) but If X1 ~ N(μ, σ2) then, 2 X1 ~ N(2 μ, 4 σ2 ) If X1 ~ N(μ, σ2) and X2 ~ N(μ, σ2) are iid normal random variables then (X1 + X2)N(μ+ μ, σ2+ σ2)(2 μ, 2 σ2) Hence, 2X1 – (X1+X2) ~(2 μ – 2 μ, 4 σ2 + 2σ2 ) The distribution remains the same for every sample subset of similar source, it tends to fall under Normal distribution and slight deviations in parameters.\n",
    "     The Normal distribution has two parameters, the mean, µ, and the variance, σ2. µ and σ2satisfy −∞ < µ < ∞, σ2> 0. We write X ∼ Normal (µ, σ2) or X ∼ N(µ, σ2 )."
